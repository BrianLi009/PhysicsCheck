**embedability:** check whether kochen specker candidates are embedable, if a candidate is indeed embedable, it is a Kochen Specker graph as desired, can be ran using 4-check-embedability.sh

**gen_cubes:** generate the cubes used in cube and conquer, merge cubes into the instance then solve using MapleSAT, can be ran using 3-cube-merge-solve.sh

**gen_instance:** include scripts that generate SAT instance of certain order with satisfying certain contraints, can be ran using 1-instance-generation.sh

**simplification:** contains script relavant to simplification in the pipeline

**1-instance-generation.sh:** script that initiate instance geenration for order n, can be called with ./1-instance-generation.sh n

**2-add-blocking-clauses.sh:** script that adds blocking clauses to constraints_n, can be called with ./2-add-blocking-clauses.sh n(graph order) o(subgraph order) f(instance filename)

**3-cube-merge-solve.sh:** script that perform incremental cubing, merge cubes into instance and solve with maplesat, can be called with ./3-cube-merge-solve.sh n(graph order) r(number of variables to eliminate) f(instance file name)

**4-check-embedability:** script that perform embedability checking on n.exhaust, which is the file that contains all kochen specker candidates output by MapleSAT. can be called with ./4-check-embedability.sh n(graph order)

**dependency-setup.sh:** script that set up all dependencies, see the script documentation for details, can be called with ./dependency-setup.sh

**main.sh:** driver script that connects all script stated above, running this script will execute the entire pipeline, can be called with ./main.sh n(graph order) s(number of times to simplify, default to be 3) r(number of variables to eliminate during incremental cubing)

**run-subgraph-generation.sh:** a script that generate blocking clauses to block non-canonical representation of a graph

**Pipeline:** 

dependencies: maplesat-ks, cadical, networkx, z3-solver, and march_cu from cube and conquer. Run dependency-setup.sh for dependency setup
