Description:
    This script generate non-canonical blocking clauses of order o using maplesat-ks, then concanate the clauses into the instance.

Usage:
    ./2-add-blocking-clauses.sh n o f

Options:
    <n>: the order of the instance/number of vertices in the graph
    <o>: the size of the noncanonical subgraph we want to generate and block
    <f>: file name of the current SAT instance
" && exit

o=$2 #subgraph's order

#concanate all blocking clauses and add them to the file
