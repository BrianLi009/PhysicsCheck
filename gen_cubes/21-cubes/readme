This directory contains a collection of cubes incrementally generated from the instance constraints_21_10.simp-noncanon.simp.

Cubing was initially done until 75 edge variables were removed from the instances associated with each cube.

Cubing was then restarted at depth 7 until 100 edge variables were removed from the instances associated with each cube.
