    This script solve a single cube.

Usage:
    ./solve-single-cube.sh 

Options:
    <n>: the order of the instance/number of vertices in the graph
    <f>: file name of the current SAT instance
    <c>: file name of the cube
    <i>: index of the cube (1-indexing)
    <d>: directory to store output files into
    <o>: simplification option, option c means simplifying for t conflicts, option v means simplify until t% of variables are eliminated
    <t>: conflicts for which to simplify each time CaDiCal is called, or % of variables to eliminate, depending on the <o> option
